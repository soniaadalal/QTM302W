# QTM302W Project Repository
### Welcome to the QTM302W project repository! This repository contains all the materials related to our semester-long project on exploratory and rhetorical analysis of quantitative data.

## Project Description
### Our project focuses on understanding the impact of US deportations on levels of violent crime in Latin America and the Caribbean, based on the study "Exporting Murder: US deportations and the Spread of Violence". We explore various factors, including deportation rates, corruption scores, and income groups, to investigate their associations with homicide rates in the region.

## Goals

### - To explore the influence of deportation rates, corruption scores, and income groups on homicide rates.
### - To provide insights into the potential factors contributing to violence in the region.
