## Objectives and Goals

- To analyze the relationship between US deportations and violent crime in Latin America and the Caribbean.
- To explore the influence of deportation rates, corruption scores, and income groups on homicide rates.
- To provide insights into the potential factors contributing to violence in the region.

## Methods

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical Modeling
- Data Visualization

## Platforms/Languages

- R
- RStudio

## Project Description

Our project focuses on understanding the impact of US deportations on levels of violent crime in Latin America and the Caribbean, based on the study "Exporting Murder: US deportations and the Spread of Violence". We explore various factors, including deportation rates, corruption scores, and income groups, to investigate their associations with homicide rates in the region.

### Research Questions

Our research aims to investigate deportation as one of the major factors corresponding to violence in the country of origin. 

Hypothesis: There exists a correlation between income groups, deportation rates, corruption, and  homicide rates

Higher deportation may be associated with higher homicide rates. 
Deportation of lower-income groups may be associated with higher homicide rates. 
Lower corruption scores indicating higher percieved corruption of the government may be associated with higher homicide rates.

## Getting Started

In this repository, you will find:

###  EDA Code Notebook: 
Our exploratory data analysis (EDA) code notebook, which includes code to replicate and further explore our findings.
### Data Files: 
Any datasets used in our analysis will be included in the "data" folder.
### Replicating Environment
Includes renv files that enable users to clone this repository to replicate the computing environment with the libraries our analysis depended on.

Feel free to explore the materials in this repository and replicate our analysis. We encourage collaboration and further exploration of the topics covered in our project.
