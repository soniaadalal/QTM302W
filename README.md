# QTM302W
### Through the course of QTM302W, we worked on a semester-long project to understand exploratory and rhetorical analysis of quantitative data. Our project forms from the study "Exporting Murder: US deportations and the Spread of Violence" where the large focus was on the impact of US deportations of convicts on levels of violent crime in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
### The United States is the largest destination for migrants in the world, with an accumulated number of deportees of almost 5.4 million between 1997 and 2015. Of these, where approximately 40%, or roughly 2.2 million had a criminal record. 
### Our research aims to investigate not only deportation as one of the major factors corresponding to violence in the country of origin but also corruption, and income groups.
#### We hypothesized that higher deportation numbers, deportation of lower-income groups, and lower corruption scores indicating higher percieved corruption of the government may be associated with higher homicide rates.

## Within this repository you will find numerous aspects of our project. Our EDA code notebook to replicate or further our findings.
